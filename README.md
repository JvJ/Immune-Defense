# Immune-Defense

Still in early stages of development.  The aim of this project is to create a tower defense game where populations of enemies are evolved using a genetic algorithm.  To do this, a [concatenative language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenative_programming_language) will be used to provide a simple form of genetic programming.  The programs will adjust the enemies' stats while also adding semi-random 3D shapes and colors to their meshes, to provide a visual cue of each enemy's genetic ancestry.
